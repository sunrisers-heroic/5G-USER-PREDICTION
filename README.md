# 5G-USER-PREDICTION
# 5G Adoption Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict 5G adoption using machine learning models. We will compare the performance of a traditional Random Forest model with a PyTorch-based Neural Network, exploring their strengths and limitations in this context.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liukunxin/dataset)

It contains various features related to user demographics, device usage, and network activity. The target variable is `is_5g`, indicating whether a user has adopted 5G technology.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., active days, user ID, area ID) to focus on relevant features.
2. **Label Encoding:** Converted the categorical target variable `is_5g` into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
3. **Data Splitting:** Divided the data into training, validation, and testing sets for model evaluation.

### Model Development

1. **Scikit-learn Random Forest:** Implemented a Random Forest model using the `RandomForestClassifier` from Scikit-learn. This model is known for its robustness and ability to handle complex relationships in data.
2. **PyTorch Neural Network:** Built a simple neural network using PyTorch with fully connected layers, ReLU activation, and a sigmoid output for binary classification. 

### Model Evaluation

1. **Metrics:** Evaluated both models using accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
2. **Comparison:** Compared the performance of the two models to identify the best approach for this prediction task.

## Results

* **Scikit-learn Random Forest:** Achieved [mention accuracy and F1 score] on the test set, demonstrating strong performance.
* **PyTorch Neural Network:** Achieved [mention accuracy and F1 score] on the test set. While not as accurate as Random Forest in this case, it showed potential for improvement with further tuning.

## Conclusion

This project aimed to predict 5G adoption using machine learning models, comparing the performance of a traditional Random Forest model with a PyTorch-based Neural Network.  

**Key Findings:**

* **Scikit-learn Random Forest:** This model demonstrated good performance, showcasing its suitability for tabular data and its ability to handle non-linear relationships and mitigate overfitting. It also offers interpretability through feature importance analysis.
* **PyTorch Neural Network:** The Neural Network approach exhibited potential for learning complex patterns but required careful tuning of hyperparameters and architecture. While it didn't outperform Random Forest in this scenario, with more data and optimization, it could achieve higher accuracy. 

**Comparison and Insights:**

* Random Forest proved to be a robust and efficient option for this prediction task, particularly given its relative ease of use and interpretability.
* The Neural Network approach showed potential but requires further experimentation with architecture, hyperparameters, and potentially data augmentation techniques to fully leverage its capabilities.
* Data suitability, hyperparameter optimization, and model complexity were key factors influencing the models' performance.

**Future Directions:**

* Explore more advanced Neural Network architectures and hyperparameter tuning techniques to potentially improve performance.
* Investigate feature engineering strategies to enhance the dataset and provide more informative input to the models.
* Consider data augmentation methods, especially for the Neural Network, to increase the training data size and potentially improve generalization.
* Experiment with other machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to compare their effectiveness for this task.

**Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the application of machine learning for predicting 5G adoption and highlighted the strengths and considerations of different modeling approaches.** By continually refining the models and data, and exploring further advancements in machine learning, we can strive for more accurate and insightful predictions in this domain.
